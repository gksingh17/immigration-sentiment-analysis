# Irish Immigration Sentiment Analysis

In today's digital age, where platforms like YouTube serve as both entertainment hubs and windows into public sentiment, our project delves into the intricacies of immigration in Ireland. Using cutting-edge NLP models, we dissect sentiments from YouTube comments in near real-time, offering nuanced insights beyond the positive vs. negative spectrum. By annotating Irish-specific immigration videos, our approach equips policymakers and analysts with a deeper understanding of evolving narratives, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex societal challenges in our ever-evolving digital landscape.

### Running Backend Services Without Docker (Windows User):

### Note: Changes Done in this section are for local testing and should not be merged with main branch.

Stop all the containers if running because they are all mapped to
their respective ports in the localhost. Then before running the services locally
please change the container name to localhost in the URLs used in code
to call the other services.

For example the YTComment.py the hostname in post call to preprocessing_script must be changed. e.g. preprocess_url = 'http://localhost:5002/api/preprocess' .
Perform these changes in urls used for calls in other services as well.
